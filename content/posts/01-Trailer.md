Hey there Mr. Retronym here, have you ever thought that what we study in our day-to-day life is just a basic of what is there in the industry. Yes, it's true the first AI system was been developed In between the 1940s and 50s since the software industries are been using all kinds of technologies are been using AI systems. In the current time, it's developing itself by using the self-learning method to improve its accuracy and performance so that it can reach a newer level. Right now AI has developed itself to that extend that in the upcoming year we will be seeing AI robots working with us as living beings. I hope that I will be providing you with best tech talk as well as with technology so that we can understand the true power of technology and don't use it for a bad purpose. Thank you
